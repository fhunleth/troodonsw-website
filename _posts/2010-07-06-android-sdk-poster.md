It seems like there should be a nice overview poster somewhere on the Android SDK. I certainly hate writing code and then finding out that similar functionality existed in the SDK, but just wasn't called what I thought. A quick search didn't reveal anything I really liked so I put together one for myself in TreeMap form. It's an eye chart, but if you print it out, it's pretty easy to see the general section of the poster to look at and then to move your head closer to see class and method names.


I've included the android.* packages, classes, and interfaces. I did not include public inner classes and interfaces to save space, but most of those are just for listeners or other helpers. API levels are marked at the class level. It's formatted for 11"x17", but it prints well for me on two letter-sized pages. Here are links to the sources. Feel free to add to or modify the poster.
